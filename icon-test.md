# Icon Migration Summary

## ✅ Completed: Tabler Icons → Lucide React Migration

### What was changed:
- **Removed**: `@tabler/icons-react` (6000+ icons causing excessive chunking)
- **Added**: `lucide-react` (optimized, tree-shakable icon library)
- **Updated**: 21+ component files with automatic icon mapping

### Bundle optimization benefits:
1. **Reduced bundle size** - Only imports icons that are actually used
2. **Better tree-shaking** - Lucide React has excellent tree-shaking support
3. **Fewer HTTP requests** - No more excessive chunk splitting for icons
4. **Faster load times** - Smaller initial bundle

### Files updated:
- `src/components/layouts/AppShell.tsx`
- `src/components/common/DataTable.tsx`
- `src/components/common/EnhancedDataTable.tsx`
- All page components (20+ files)
- All dashboard components

### Icon mapping examples:
- `IconDashboard` → `Home as IconDashboard`
- `IconChartBar` → `BarChart3 as IconChart`
- `IconUsers` → `Users as IconUsers`
- `IconDotsVertical` → `MoreVertical as IconDotsVertical`

### How to add new icons:
```tsx
import { NewIcon as IconNewIcon } from 'lucide-react';
```

The migration is complete and all TypeScript checks pass. The app should now have significantly better bundle performance.
