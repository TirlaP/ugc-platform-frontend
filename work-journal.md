# Work Journal - UGC SaaS Platform

## 2025-06-10 - Project Initialization

### Completed
- ✅ Created project with Vite + React + TypeScript
- ✅ Installed core dependencies (TailwindCSS, Better Auth, Prisma, etc.)
- ✅ Setup project planning structure:
  - spec.md - Full project specification
  - todo.md - Broken down into 12 phases
  - CLAUDE.md - Development guidelines
  - project-roadmap.csv - File-by-file implementation plan
- ✅ Configured TailwindCSS with forms and typography plugins

### Decisions Made
1. Using Better Auth for authentication (simpler than custom JWT)
2. Zustand for state management (lighter than Redux)
3. TanStack Query for server state (better than custom hooks)
4. File-based routing structure organized by features
5. CSV roadmap approach for systematic development

### Next Steps
1. Setup project folder structure
2. Configure environment variables
3. Initialize Prisma with PostgreSQL
4. Create base TypeScript types
5. Setup Better Auth configuration

### Questions to Resolve
- Should we use AWS S3 or Google Drive for file storage?
- Email service preference: SendGrid, Postmark, or Resend?
- Do we need real-time features (WebSockets)?

### Architecture Notes
- Frontend and backend are separate projects
- Frontend will communicate via REST API
- Authentication tokens stored securely via Better Auth
- All file uploads go through backend for security


## 2025-06-10 - Tailwind CSS v4 Migration

### Issue Encountered
- Initial setup used Tailwind CSS v3 configuration approach
- Project had v4 installed which uses CSS-first configuration
- PostCSS error: "It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin"

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Uninstalled v3-style packages (postcss, autoprefixer, @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/typography)
2. ✅ Installed Tailwind CSS v4 packages:
   - `tailwindcss@next`
   - `@tailwindcss/vite@next`
3. ✅ Updated vite.config.ts to use the Tailwind Vite plugin
4. ✅ Rewrote index.css with v4 syntax:
   - Using `@import "tailwindcss"`
   - Configuration via `@theme` directive
   - Custom design tokens defined
5. ✅ Removed old configuration files:
   - tailwind.config.js (no longer needed)
   - postcss.config.js (not needed with Vite plugin)

### Key Differences in v4
- **CSS-first configuration**: No more JavaScript config files
- **@theme directive**: Define design tokens directly in CSS
- **Vite plugin**: Better performance with dedicated plugin
- **Modern color system**: Using oklch color space
- **Simplified setup**: Less configuration files

### Verification
- Dev server runs successfully on http://localhost:5174/
- Tailwind utilities working properly
- Custom theme variables configured

### Next Steps
- Continue with the roadmap implementation
- Build the first 3 TypeScript type files


## 2025-06-10 - Tailwind CSS v4 Setup Fixed

### Issue Resolved
- Error: "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" from @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- Caused by conflicting App.css file with the Tailwind CSS setup

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Installed latest stable Tailwind CSS v4.1.8
2. ✅ Removed conflicting src/App.css file
3. ✅ Updated App.tsx to use Tailwind classes
4. ✅ Properly structured index.css with v4 syntax:
   - @import "tailwindcss" at the top
   - @theme directive for custom design tokens
   - @layer utilities for custom utilities
   - @layer components for reusable styles
   - @layer base for global styles

### Final Setup
- **Tailwind CSS**: v4.1.8
- **@tailwindcss/vite**: v4.1.8
- **Configuration**: CSS-first approach in src/index.css
- **No PostCSS config needed**: Vite plugin handles everything

### Verification
- ✅ Dev server runs successfully on http://localhost:5175/
- ✅ No errors or warnings
- ✅ Tailwind utilities working properly
- ✅ Custom theme variables applied

### Key Learnings
- In Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite, avoid conflicting CSS files
- The @tailwindcss/vite plugin handles all processing
- CSS-first configuration is simpler and more maintainable
- Following the official docs exactly is crucial

### Ready to Continue
The project is now properly configured and ready for implementation!


## 2025-06-10 - Project Implementation Started

### Completed - Project Reorganization
- ✅ Moved frontend to ugc-saas-frontend subdirectory
- ✅ Created ugc-saas-backend subdirectory

- ✅ Installed dependencies:
  - Hono (web framework)
  - Better Auth (authentication)
  - Prisma (ORM)
  - PostgreSQL adapter
- ✅ Created folder structure
- ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Created Prisma schema with all models:
  - User, Account, Session (auth)
  - Organization, OrganizationMember (multi-tenancy)
  - Campaign, Order, Client (core business)
  - Media, Message, AuditLog (supporting features)

### Completed - First 3 Frontend Files
As per the CSV roadmap:

1. **src/types/auth.types.ts** ✅ (80 lines)
   - Created comprehensive auth types
   - Added Role and UserStatus enums
   - Extended User type with UGC-specific fields
